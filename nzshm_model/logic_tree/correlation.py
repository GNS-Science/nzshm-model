class Correlation:
    """
    A correlation between **BranchSet**s of a logic tree. Correlations are used when buiding combinations of branches
    from differnt **BranchSet**s.

    For example, if a logic tree contains branchets A and B each with branches A1, A2 and B1, B2, respectivly, then
    a correlation A1, B1 will only allow A1-B1 not A1-B2 as valid composite branches.

    The primary_brach will not appear in combination with any branches except those identified in associated_branches
    for the relevent **BranchSet**s

    Arguments:
        primary_branch: the branch that **MUST** be correlated with the associated brances.
        associated_branches: list of branches that the primary_branch must always be coupled with.
        weight: weight used for composite branch formed by correlation. Defaults to weight of primary_branch
